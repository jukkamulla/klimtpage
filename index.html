        <h3>Gustav Klimt</h3>
        <p>Gustav Klimt (July 14, 1862 – February 6, 1918) was an Austrian symbolist painter and one of the most
            prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. Klimt is noted for his paintings, murals, sketches,
            and other objets d'art. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked
            by a frank eroticism. In addition to his figurative works, which include allegories and portraits,
            he painted landscapes. Among the artists of the Vienna Secession, Klimt was the most influenced
            by Japanese art and its methods.
        </p>
        <p>Early in his artistic career he was a successful painter of architectural decorations in a conventional
            manner. As he developed a more personal style, his work was the subject of controversy that culminated
            when the paintings he completed around 1900 for the ceiling of the Great Hall of the University of Vienna
            were criticized as pornographic. He subsequently accepted no more public commissions, but achieved a new
            success with the paintings of his 'golden phase', many of which include gold leaf. Klimt's work was an
            important influence on his younger contemporary Egon Schiele.

        <p>In 1894, Klimt was commissioned to create three paintings to decorate the ceiling of the Great Hall
            of the University of Vienna. Not completed until the turn of the century, his three paintings,
            Philosophy, Medicine, and Jurisprudence were criticized for their radical themes and material,
            and were called "pornographic". Klimt had transformed traditional allegory and symbolism into a new
            language that was more overtly sexual and hence more disturbing to some. The public outcry came from
            all quarters—political, aesthetic and religious. As a result, the paintings (seen in gallery below)
            were not displayed on the ceiling of the Great Hall. This would be the last public commission accepted
            by the artist.
           All three paintings were destroyed by retreating SS forces in May 1945.
        </p>
        <p>The only folio set produced in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by
            H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition
            of 300, supervised personally by the artist. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings
            (1893–1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper
            with deckled edges.
        </p>
        <p>Each of the fifty prints was categorized among five themes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allegorical (which included multicolored prints of The Golden Knight,
                1903 and The Virgin, c. 1912)</li>
            <li>Erotic-Symbolist (Water Serpents I and II, both c. 1907–08 and The Kiss, c. 1908)</li>
            <li>Landscapes (Farm Garden with Sunflowers, c. 1912)</li>
            <li>Mythical or Biblical (Pallas Athena, 1898; Judith and The Head of Holofernes, 1901;
                and Danaë, c. 1908)</li>
            <li>Portraits (Emilie Flöge, 1902)</li>
        </ul>
